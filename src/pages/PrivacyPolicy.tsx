                <h4 id='section3'>3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your personal information?</h4>
                <p className='lead'>
                    <b>In short:</b> <i>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</i><br/>

                    <b><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href='#withdraw'>here</a> to learn more.</li>

                        <li><b>Legitimate Interests.</b> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>

                        <li><b>Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>

                    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
                    <ul>

                        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                        <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

                    If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.<br/>

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br/>

To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.

                    <b>Financial Incentives</b><br/>
                    "Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal information.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer's data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer's data. The explanation must include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer's data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference; and</li>
                        <li>a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer's data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the retention, sale, or sharing of a consumer's personal information.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and explain the price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference, including the categories of personal information that are implicated by the financial incentive or price or service difference.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by visiting trest,cin.test, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
